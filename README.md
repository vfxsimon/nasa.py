## Install

```

## Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Tilt from 'react-parallax-tilt';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Tilt>
      <div style={{ height: '300px', backgroundColor: 'darkgreen' }}>
        <h1>React Parallax Tilt 👀</h1>
      </div>
    </Tilt>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Gyroscope - Device Orientation

Please keep in mind that detecting device orientation is currently [experimental technology](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#Experimental).  
Check the [browser compatibility](https://caniuse.com/#search=DeviceOrientation) before using this in production.  
A few takeaways when using device orientation event:

- always use secure origins (such as `https`)
- it doesn't work in all browsers when using it in cross-origin `<iframe>` element

<details>
<summary>Using device orientation on iOS 13+</summary>

Apple decided turning device motion and orientation off by default since iOS 12.2.  
With iOS 13+ permission API can be used to gain access to device orientation event.

When using gyroscope feature:

```jsx
<Tilt gyroscope={true}>
  <h1>React Parallax Tilt 👀</h1>
</Tilt>
```

it will present a permission dialog prompting the user to allow motion and orientation access at domain level:

Note that user needs to take some action (like tapping a button) to be able to display the dialog (invoking dialog on page load is not possible).
